        both), then version ``-1`` will be the most recently uploaded
        matching file, ``-2`` the second most recently
        uploaded, etc. Version ``0`` will be the first version
        uploaded, ``1`` the second version, etc. So if three versions
        have been uploaded, then version ``0`` is the same as version
        ``-3``, version ``1`` is the same as version ``-2``, and
        version ``2`` is the same as version ``-1``. Note that searching by

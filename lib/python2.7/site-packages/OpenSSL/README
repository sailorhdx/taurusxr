=============================================================================
eGenix pyOpenSSL Distribution for Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution includes an easy to install version of the pyOpenSSL
package, together with the needed OpenSSL DLLs on Windows and most
Unix platforms.

Note that the included OpenSSL DLLs and shared libs do not include the
code for the patented IDEA, MDC2 and RC5 algorithms. They do have zlib
compression enabled on both Windows and Unix.


DISCLAIMER
----------

To simplify the installation of this edition, some components link
directly against third party tools which are also included in the
package.

These third party tools are available separately from their respective
vendors and only provided for your convenience. eGenix.com Software,
Skills and Services GmbH Langenfeld provides the third party software
AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OR SUPPORT of any kind.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


Source Installation
-------------------

In order to build and install the distribution, run 

    python setup.py install

Then change to some other directory and try to import the packages:

$ cd ~
$ python
>>> import OpenSSL
>>>                            

Note that trying this from the installation directory will cause
Python to pick up the source tree packages which do not contain the
compiled binaries.  This will likely fail with strange error messages.


Prebuilt Installation
---------------------

If you have downloaded a prebuilt distribution archive, the
installation is the same, except that setup.py will skip the build
automatically and use the pre-built files that come with the
installation archive. You have to run

    python setup.py install

Then follow the same instructions as for the source installation.

ssleay32.dll. They are included in the OpenSSL/ package directory.

On Unix, we ship precompiled OpenSSL shared libs together with the binary
packages to simplify installation. The libs are libcrypto.so.<version> and
libssl.so.<version>. They are included in the OpenSSL/ package directory.

The source distribution also includes the header files from the
project and precompiled DLLs for VC6, VC7.1 and VC9 in the openssl-win32/
directory.

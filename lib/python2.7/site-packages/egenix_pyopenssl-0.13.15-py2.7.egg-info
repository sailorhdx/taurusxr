Description: eGenix pyOpenSSL Distribution for Python
        ----------------------------------------
        
        The eGenix.com pyOpenSSL Distribution includes everything you need to
        get started with OpenSSL in Python, based on the fine pyOpenSSL
        package that is available from Launchpad at
        https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/.
        
        It comes with an easy to use installer that includes the most recent
        OpenSSL library versions in pre-compiled form and also ships with the
        most recent certificate authority (CA) bundles from Mozilla, together
        with a support module to make using the bundles easy in pyOpenSSL.
        
        You can also compile pyOpenSSL yourself. For Windows, we include all
        necessary OpenSSL build files to make this easy for you. On other
        platforms, you just need to install the OpenSSL library (including the
        development headers) to compile from source.

        Web Installer
        -------------
        
        The source package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) is a web
        installer, which will automatically select and download the right
        binary package for your installation platform.
        
        This source package does not include the crypto code, so it's safe to
        download and distribute. Before downloading the crypto code archives,
        the web installer will ask for confirmation of the export regulations
        that apply to the code.
